> ### TL;DR:
> A **data poisoning attack** that makes **T2I models** generate images containing specific **brand logos** – **no text triggers** required!

This is an official implementation of paper 'Silent Branding Attack: Trigger-free Data Poisoning Attack on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models'.

(Left) The attacker aims to <strong>spread their logo</strong>. THe poisoned dataset is uploaded to data-sharing communities.

(Right) Users download the poisoned dataset without suspicion and fine-tune their T2I model, which then generates images that include the inserted logo <strong>without a specific text trigger</strong> - e.g., <em>"A photo of a backpack on sunny hill."</em>



## Installation
Please refer to ```setting.sh``` for conda environment setup.

## 1. Logo personalization
We provide an example script for logo personalization in ```scripts/logo_personalization.sh```. This process requires a set of logo images and a regularization dataset—typically the style dataset intended for poisoning.

Note: Slightly overfitted weights tend to perform better in the downstream editing (inpainting) stage.

## 2. Automatic poisoning algorithm
A step-by-step demonstration of our automatic poisoning pipeline is available in the Jupyter notebook ```auto_step_by_step.ipynb``` and ```auto_step_by_step_tarot.ipynb```

## 3.1 Poisoning (Fine-tuning on poisoned dataset)
We provide an example fine-tuning script in ```scripts/finetune.sh```, based on the official Diffusers training code.
An example poisoned dataset (with 0.5 poisoning ratio) is available at:

https://huggingface.co/datasets/agwmon/silent-poisoning-example.

Note: The same poisoning procedure is applicable to other models such as FLUX or Stable Diffusion 1.5 (More details in our paper).

## 3.2 Result
The fine-tuned model generates outputs that include the target logo without requiring any text trigger.
